# ETL-Using-Pandas
In this project, I created a dashboard using the market capitalization of some of the worldâ€™s largest banks. The market capitalization is the total value of the outstanding shares of a company.

The main steps I followed in this project were:

Step 1: I extracted data from a JSON file named bank_market_cap.json, which contains the name and market cap of the banks in different currencies.
Step 2: I converted the market cap values into USD using another JSON file named exchange_rate.json, which contains the exchange rates of different currencies against USD.
Step 3: I loaded the converted data into a CSV file named bank_market_cap_usd.csv, which contains the name and market cap (USD) of the banks.
This project was part of the IBM Data Engineering Specialization on Coursera, which is a course that teaches me how to design, build, and manage data pipelines using various tools and technologies. This project helped me to practice and improve my skills in ETL using pandas, which is a powerful and versatile library for data analysis and manipulation.
