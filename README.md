# ETL-Using-Pandas
In this project, I applied the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using the pandas library in Python. ETL is a process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a desired format, and loading it into a destination system for analysis or other purposes.

The data source I used for this project was the yfinance API, which provides historical and real-time financial data for stocks, currencies, cryptocurrencies, and options. I also worked with data in JSON and CSV formats, which are common data interchange formats that store structured or semi-structured data.

The main steps I followed in this project were:

- Step 1: I used the yfinance library to extract data from the yfinance API. I specified the ticker symbols, the start and end dates, and the frequency of the data I wanted to retrieve. I also handled any errors or exceptions that might occur during the extraction process.
- Step 2: I used the pandas library to transform the data I extracted. I performed various operations on the data. I also cleaned and formatted the data to make it consistent and readable.
- Step 3: I used the pandas library to load the data into different destinations. I saved the data into JSON and CSV files, which can be easily shared and accessed by other applications or users. I also loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure that allows me to manipulate and analyze the data using various methods and attributes.

This project was part of the IBM Data Engineering Specialization on Coursera, which is a course that teaches me how to design, build, and manage data pipelines using various tools and technologies. This project helped me to practice and improve my skills in ETL using pandas, which is a powerful and versatile library for data analysis and manipulation.
